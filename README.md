# AutoZone Professional Motor Spare Parts

## ERP System Requirements Document

### Based on Departmental Interviews Conducted on [Date]

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the key operational challenges and automation opportunities identified during onsite interviews with AutoZone’s sales, CRM, verification, stores, and dispatch teams. The findings will guide the development of an ERP system to streamline workflows alongside the existing bookkeeping (BK) system.

## 2. Current System Assessment

### 2.1 Existing Bookkeeping (BK) System
The company currently relies on a BK system for core financial operations, including:

- Creating customer estimates and invoices
- Recording payments and receipts
- Generating proforma invoices

#### Critical Limitations Observed:
- No real-time communication between departments, requiring manual follow-ups.
- Data silos force teams to re-enter information across multiple platforms.
- Paper-based processes for delivery notes and courier tracking lead to delays and errors.

## 3. Department-Specific Challenges & Requirements

### 3.1 Sales Team (Field Agents)
**Current Workflow:**
Field agents negotiate spare parts prices with customers, create estimates in the BK system, and physically deliver paperwork to the CRM office. After parts are delivered, they collect signed delivery notes from customers and return them to dispatch.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Estimate status blindness: Agents cannot track if estimates are approved or fulfilled.
- Delivery confirmation delays: Physical document collection slows down order closure.
- Duplicate data entry: Must log details in both BK system and Excel trackers.

**ERP Solutions Proposed:**
- Mobile estimate submission with BK system reference IDs.
- Digital delivery proof upload via phone camera scans.
- Real-time notifications when estimates are processed by other departments.

### 3.2 CRM Team
**Current Workflow:**
The CRM team receives paper estimates from sales, manually checks the BK system for updates, and routes approved estimates to the verification office.

**Key Pain Points:**
- No automated alerts for new estimates, requiring constant BK system refreshing.
- Status tracking gaps: Cannot see where estimates are stuck in the pipeline.

**ERP Solutions Proposed:**
- Centralized estimate dashboard showing all open/closed requests.
- Automated notifications when sales submit new estimates or status changes occur.

### 3.3 Verification Office
**Current Workflow:**
This team manually verifies estimate pricing and inventory availability, then returns approved estimates to CRM for stores processing.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Paper handoffs cause miscommunication and delays.
- No audit trail of verification decisions.

**ERP Solutions Proposed:**
- Digital approval system with comment fields for rejections.
- Automatic routing to stores upon approval.

### 3.4 Stores Team
**Current Workflow:**
Stores staff prepare orders based on verified estimates, generate proforma invoices in the BK system, and manually reconcile deliveries against original estimates in Excel.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Error-prone reconciliation: Manual data entry leads to mismatches.
- No integration between BK invoices and physical inventory.

**ERP Solutions Proposed:**
- Digital dispatch checklist linked to BK invoice IDs.
- Automated reconciliation tool comparing estimates vs. deliveries.

### 3.5 Dispatch Team
**Current Workflow:**
Dispatch logs courier details (driver, vehicle, cost) in paper registers, waits for physical delivery notes from sales, and updates Excel trackers upon receipt.

**Key Pain Points:**
- No real-time delivery tracking: Relies on slow paper returns.
- Duplicate records: Same data entered in registers and Excel.

**ERP Solutions Proposed:**
- Digital courier management console with structured data entry.
- One-click delivery confirmation when sales upload signed proofs.

## 4. Proposed ERP Solution

### 4.1 Core Automated Workflows

#### A. Estimate-to-Delivery Pipeline
1. Sales creates estimate in BK system → ERP captures reference ID.
2. CRM receives instant notification and routes for verification.
3. Verification team approves digitally → auto-notifies stores.
4. Stores prepare order and generate BK proforma invoice.
5. Dispatch logs courier details in ERP upon shipment.
6. Sales upload signed delivery note → dispatch confirms with one click.

#### B. Stores Reconciliation
- Automated variance reporting between:
  - Original estimate quantities/prices
  - Actual delivered items (from delivery proofs)
- Digital audit trail for all adjustments.

### 4.2 Technical Implementation

| Phase | Module | Key Features | Technology |
|-------|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Phase 1 (Demo Priorities)** | Estimate Tracking | BK ID sync, status updates | Django, Django REST Framework |
| | Delivery Proof | Mobile photo upload, cloud storage | Django-Storages, Amazon S3 |
| | Dispatch Console | Courier detail management | HTMX for fast UI updates |
| **Phase 2 (Post-Hire)** | BK system API Integration | Bidirectional data sync | - |
| | Advanced Analytics | Inventory forecasting | - |

## 5. Expected Outcomes

### 5.1 Efficiency Gains
- Eliminate 100% of manual Excel tracking.
- Reduce estimate-to-delivery time by 50% through real-time notifications.

### 5.2 Error Reduction
- Near-zero data entry errors via automated reconciliation.
- Complete audit trails for all departmental handoffs.
